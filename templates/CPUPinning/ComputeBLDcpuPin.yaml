parameters:
  ## NovaVcpuPinSet:
  ##########
  # Sets cores for CPU pinning. The Compute node uses these cores for guest instances. NovaVcpuPinSet is used as the vcpu_pin_set value in the nova.conf file.
  # [Moe] Exclude all cores from the NeutronDpdkCoreList and the HostCpusList.
  # [Moe] Include all remaining cores.
  # [Moe] Pair the sibling threads together.
  NovaVcpuPinSet: "'4,6,8,10,1,3,5,7,9,11,16,18,20,22,13,15,17,19,21,23'"

  ## HostIsolatedCpuList
  ##########
  # A set of CPU cores isolated from the host processes. This parameter is used as the isolated_cores value in the cpu-partitioning-variable.conf file for the tuned-profiles-cpu-partitioning component.
  # [Moe] Match the list of cores in NeutronDpdkCoreList and NovaVcpuPinSet.
  # [Moe] Pair the sibling threads together.
  HostIsolatedCoreList: "'4,6,8,10,1,3,5,7,9,11,16,18,20,22,13,15,17,19,21,23'"

  ## HostCpusList
  ##########
  # Provides CPU cores for non data path OVS-DPDK processes, such as handler and revalidator threads. This parameter has no impact on overall data path performance on multi-NUMA node hardware. This parameter is used for the dpdk-lcore-mask value in Open vSwitch, and these cores are shared with the host.
  # [Moe] Allocate the first physical core (and sibling thread) from each NUMA node (even if the NUMA node has no associated DPDK NIC).
  # [Moe] These cores must be mutually exclusive from the list of cores in NeutronDpdkCoreList and NovaVcpuPinSet.
  HostCpusList: "0,12,2,14"
